AN1 Engine: High-Performance LLM Operations

AN1 Engine is a public API and benchmark suite for the AN1 accelerated attention layer, delivering validated 7.21×+ speedup on NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs. Provides accelerated implementations of attention and matrix multiplication operations with automatic fallback to baseline PyTorch implementations.
AN1 backend

This repo contains:

    A readable PyTorch baseline
    The public an1_cache API
    Benchmarks and tests

The actual acceleration comes from AN1, a closed binary backend (an1_core_gpu) that is not included here.

This repository does not contain the AN1 kernel source code or scheduling logic. All low level implementations live in a separate closed source package (an1_core_gpu).

When an1_core_gpu is installed and AN1_LICENSE_KEY is set, the same API automatically routes to the accelerated backend.

For pilot access or evaluation on your own H100 / A100 / L40S hardware, contact: Ryan@animacore.ai or 305-505-5268.
Features

    Accelerated Attention: Optimized scaled dot-product attention for transformer models
    Accelerated Matrix Multiplication: High-performance matmul operations
    Automatic Backend Selection: Seamlessly falls back to PyTorch when acceleration is unavailable
    License-Based Access: Fast backend requires valid license key for enterprise partners
    Real GPU Performance: All benchmarks use actual GPU execution with proper timing
    Production Ready: Tested on H100, A100, L40S, and other modern GPUs

Installation

pip install -e .

For development with tests:

pip install -e ".[dev]"

Quick Start

import torch
from an1_cache import llm_attention

# Create input tensors: (batch, n_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
q = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)

# Compute attention (automatically uses AN1 backend if available and licensed)
output = llm_attention(q, k, v, causal=True)

API Reference
llm_attention(q, k, v, *, backend="auto", causal=True, scale=None)

Compute scaled dot-product attention.

Arguments:

    q: Query tensor of shape (batch, n_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
    k: Key tensor of shape (batch, n_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
    v: Value tensor of shape (batch, n_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
    backend: Backend to use ("an1", "baseline", or "auto"). Can also be set via AN1_BACKEND environment variable.
    causal: If True, apply causal masking (default: True)
    scale: Attention scale factor. If None, uses 1/sqrt(head_dim). Only used with baseline backend.

Returns:

    Output tensor of shape (batch, n_heads, seq_len, head_dim)

matmul(a, b, *, backend="auto")

Matrix multiplication.

Arguments:

    a: Left tensor, shape (..., m, k)
    b: Right tensor, shape (..., k, n)
    backend: Backend to use ("an1", "baseline", or "auto")

Returns:

    Output tensor of shape (..., m, n)

Backend Selection

The library automatically selects the best available backend:

    If an1_core_gpu is installed, AN1_LICENSE_KEY is set with a valid key, and backend="auto" (or AN1_BACKEND=an1), it uses the accelerated AN1 backend
    Otherwise, it falls back to the reference PyTorch implementation

You can explicitly control the backend:

# Force AN1 backend (requires valid license key)
output = llm_attention(q, k, v, backend="an1")

# Force baseline PyTorch
output = llm_attention(q, k, v, backend="baseline")

# Automatic selection (default)
output = llm_attention(q, k, v, backend="auto")

License Key Setup

To use the accelerated AN1 backend, you need:

    Install the private an1_core_gpu wheel package
    Set the AN1_LICENSE_KEY environment variable with a valid license key

export AN1_LICENSE_KEY="your-license-key-here"
python your_script.py

On Windows:

set AN1_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here
python your_script.py

If the license key is missing or invalid, the library automatically falls back to the baseline PyTorch implementation.
Performance (H100 NVL example)

This repository ships a clear PyTorch baseline and a plug-in socket for the closed AN1 backend.

The numbers below come from the benchmark harness in bench/llm_bench.py, run on a single NVIDIA H100 NVL with PyTorch 2.8 and CUDA 12.9.

Configuration

    Device: NVIDIA H100 NVL
    Batch size: 8
    Sequence length: 2048
    Attention heads: 32
    Head dimension: 128
    Dtype: fp16
    Warmup: 10 iterations
    Measured: 100 iterations

Results
Backend 	Latency (ms) 	Tokens / sec 	TFLOPs 	Speedup vs baseline
Baseline (PyTorch) 	9.701 	1,688,951 	56.67 	1.00x
AN1 backend (private) 	1.346 	12,171,685 	408.41 	7.21×+

These results were produced with:

python -m bench.llm_bench \
  --seq-len 2048 \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --n-heads 32 \
  --head-dim 128 \
  --dtype fp16 \
  --backend-baseline \
  --backend-an1

This benchmark demonstrates a validated 7.21×+ speedup for attention on NVIDIA H100 NVL. The performance may improve further depending on model size, batch scheduling, and AN1-specific reuse optimizations.
🌱 Energy Efficiency: H100 NVL Power + Speed Results

AN1 was profiled using NVIDIA NVML (pynvml) to measure average GPU power during attention workloads.
A second benchmark pass on H100 NVL captured both latency and power draw, using the same public API and a valid AN1 license key.

Configuration (same as baseline):

    FP16
    Batch = 8
    Seq Len = 2048
    Heads = 32
    Head Dim = 128
    50 timed iterations, 10 warmup

Measured Results (H100 NVL):
Backend 	Latency (ms) 	Tokens/sec 	TFLOPs 	Avg Power (W)
Baseline (PyTorch) 	14.13 	1.16M 	38.9 	80.22
AN1 Engine 	1.23 	13.29M 	445.9 	73.72

Impact:

    AN1 completes attention operations ~11.3× faster
    Power draw is nearly the same or slightly lower
    Because energy = power × time, AN1 reduces energy per attention step by ~90 percent

    ⚡ Conclusion: AN1 is not just faster — it is a green accelerator that delivers high throughput with dramatically lower energy cost.

Quick Benchmark Scripts

On Windows:

test_5x_target.bat

On Linux (for H100):

./run_bench_h100.sh

Testing

Run correctness tests:

pytest tests/test_llm_correctness.py -v

Tests verify that AN1-accelerated operations produce results matching the reference implementation within acceptable numerical tolerances.
Architecture

This library provides a clean public API that dispatches to either:

    AN1 GPU Backend (an1_cache.gpu_backend): Thin wrappers around the private an1_core_gpu package

The actual kernel implementations, optimization logic, and scheduling algorithms are not included in this repository. They are provided by the separate an1_core_gpu package, which is distributed as a binary-only wheel.
